### Latest Patch Notes

##### 11/22/2020 0204am
I've updated and added some custom files to certain filter lines so items in-game will be easier to detect by sound or visuals. Those sound files need to be placed in the same folder as your filter file into the following folder:
%userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile.

This is a list of all used custom sounds:
- 6veryvaluable.mp3
- 1maybevaluable.mp3
- 3uniques.mp3
- 2currency.mp3
- 12leveling.mp3
- 4maps.mp3
- 5highmaps.mp3

You can also visit https://www.pathofexile.com/item-filter/JvKp1iX and just click to auto add it to your game as well as it will stay updated via versions. You can also post bugs and concerns here https://github.com/FiVVR/TemperBunnys-POEFilter/issues. I use this very often.
